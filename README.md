# 1975 Porsche 911 (930) Turbo - 3D Model

911 Turbo is a 3-D web applciation that is created using the javascript library called **"Three.js"**. I create this 3D to show my appreciation for cars and in this case specifically the Porsche 911. 
This particular model is the 930 generation built in West Germany between 1975 and 1989, a Turbo version with a 3.0 liter air-cooled, turbocharged engine. Credits to **Lionsharp Studios** and
copyrights to the vehicle design belong to Porsche AG.
